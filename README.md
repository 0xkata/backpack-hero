Known Bugs:
Map occassionally does not generate when start game is pressed, simply close and rerun the file

Missing Functionalities (All core gameplay elements are present):
- A few status effects are missing
- A few events / rooms are missing
- The number of enemies, floors, items decreased
- No animations
- No longer gain items after winning a battle (it was too easy like this)
- Counter-clockwise rotation removed (only clockwise with 'W')

No cheats because the game is very easy and fast.
After the game is over, (win or lose) it will close. Run it again to start a new game.

Roni:
- Backpack
- Items
- Fight system
- Mouse tracking

Anthony:
- Probably 70% of the graphics
- Map
- Events / Rooms

Rest was togetherish
